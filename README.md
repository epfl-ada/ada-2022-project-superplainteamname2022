What is affecting movies' box office revenue? An analysis of movies themselves and external factors.

## Abstract

The box office revenue of a movie can be affected by multiple factors. Internal factors such as plots and actors as well as external factors like other movies released in the same period can have a large impact on a movie's revenue. Studying the effect of plots, actors, and same-period movies on the revenue of movies can shed light on what movies should filmmakers make if they want to earn more. In this project, we first investigate what topics and keywords do those blockbusters have in their plots to show the effect of movie plots. Then we try to find certain actors that can bring more money to a certain kind of movies but can potentially doom the revenue of other kinds of movies. Finally, we will show the effect of other top-selling movies on movies in the same period.

## Research Questions
1. What do those blockbusters have in their plots?
We want to see whether the top-selling movies are characterized by certain topics or keywords both qualitatively and quantitatively. Moreover, do those money-making keywords and topics change with movie genres and time?
2. Before casting an actor, does the actor fit the movie?
Is there a certain set of actors that can bring much more revenue to movies belonging to certain topics or keywords clusters, but have terrible performance under other kinds of movies?
3. How will top blockbusters affect the revenues of other movies released in a close period?
