## Overview

The box office revenue of a movie is one of the most critical measurements of its success. The revenue of a movie can be affected by multiple factors.  Internal factors such as topic and keywords in movie plots and actors as well as external factors like other movies released in the same period can have a large impact on a movie's revenue. Studying the effect of plots, actors, and same-period movies on the revenue of movies can shed light on what movies should filmmakers make if they want to earn more, and can give an overview of the development of the movie industry. In this project, we first investigate what topics and keywords those blockbusters have in their plots to show the effect of movie plots. Then we try to find certain actors that can bring more money to a certain kind of movie but can potentially doom the revenue of other kinds of movies. Finally, we will show the effect of other top-selling movies on movies in the same period. The dataset we use, CMU Movie Summary Corpus, contains 81741 movies and 39088 of them have a plot. Among the 39088 movies, 10306 of them have revenue data after our data completion. We conduct our analysis on those 39088 movies and draw conclusions from those movies that have revenue data.

First, let's look at the overall annual average revenue of movies, to have a rough glance at the development movie industry.

We can see that the average annual revenue of the film industry has increased over time (good to hear this!), reflecting the thriving development of the film industry and the enhancement of people's purchasing power.


## Question 1: What do those blockbusters have in their plots?

Plot is one of the most important elements of a good movie. A good plot can make the audience willing to buy a ticket, while a terrible one can doom a movie, no matter how cool the special effects are. We consider two perspectives to study the movie plots, namely topics and keywords. The topic is a top-down way of investigating the plots, looking at the overall frequency of words, namely bag-of-word modeling, while keywords are bottom-up manner, extracting information from a single movie plot and doing further grouping. First, let's extract the topics from all the movie plots. 

### 1.1 What are the topics in those movies?

We first use topic modeling to extract topics from movie plots and visualize the top 15 weighted words in each topic.

Topics are different from each other. For example, topic 13 contains some negative words like "kill, destroy, attack" (`Iron Man` is in this topic) while topic 5 contains some postive words like "marry, love, life, familiy" (`Mamma Mia!` is in this topic). 

### 1.2 Is the movie revenue in each topic group different from each other?
